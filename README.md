Warning: This project is not maintained actively. Whilst a good start to using prisma in a monorepo, I would update dependencies before starting to work with it to ensure things are up to date and secure.

# prisma-express-react

Prisma, TypeScript, Next.js + Fastify monorepo example. Has a shared package for schemas and more.
